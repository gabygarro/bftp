    /* The pthread_create function creates a new thread.
       The first parameter is a pointer to a pthread_t variable, which we can use
       in the remainder of the program to manage this thread.
       The second parameter is used to specify the attributes of this new thread
       (e.g., its stack size). We can leave it NULL here.
       The third parameter is the function this thread will run. This function *must*
       have the following prototype:

           void *f(void *args);

       Note how the function expects a single parameter of type void*. The fourth
       parameter to pthread_create is used to specify this parameter. In this case,
       we have no parameters to pass to the thread function, so we leave it NULL.
       If we _do_ need to pass parameters, we will typically malloc a struct
       with the necessary args. The thread function is typically responsible
       for freeing this struct.

       The thread we are creating here is the "server thread", which will be
       responsible for listening on port 23300 for incoming connections. This thread,
       in turn, will spawn threads to service each incoming connection, allowing
       multiple clients to connect simultaneously.

       Note that, in this particular example, creating a "server thread" is redundant,
       since there will only be one server thread, and the program's main thread (the 
           one running main()) could fulfill this purpose. */

   and we will use sockaddr_storage when accepting a client connection
   (instead of using sockaddr_in, which assumes that the incoming connection
   is coming from an IPv4 host).
   Additionally, this function will spawn a new thread for each new client
   connection.
